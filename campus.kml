The Bogota Savings Bank Center is on the Hackensack side of the campus, and is the primary athletic and recreational facility for the Metropolitan Campus.

The building consists of three key areas of operation and function: 
<ul>
<li>
Four playing courts which can be configured for any combination of basketball, tennis or volleyball games.  The two central courts are wood. The non-wood floor area of the main arena are surfaced with synthetic material which provides a quality playing surface for a variety of physical activity
</li>
<li>
A six-lane, 200-meter track encircling the main arena playing courts and a long jump pit. 
</li>
<li>
The Stratis Lounge overlooking the main arena from the mezzanine level, featuring a reception area and seating for up to 150.
</li>
</ul>
